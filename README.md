Daemon is a interactive screensaver/ cli pet at the moment it just works as a idle screensaver, once this version the (bat) is working smoothly so it keeps exploring around the screen, insert some background elements, like stars the moon, ground.
ill start making a heap of different pets/ daemons and expand from there, make it more interactive
